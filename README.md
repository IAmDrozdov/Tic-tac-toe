# Tic-tac-toe

In this project I propose to examine "the social network" for fans of all the familiar game "tic-tac-toe". Here you can send to another user, request the game, also you can post a public request for the game, which may respond by any user. In addition, it is planned to add support for selecting the size of the field, which will be the game, because 3x3 field ends quickly, and for it for a very long time exists a winning strategy.
